OBJECTIVE:
This program will allow the user to play Rock Paper Scissors against the computer
-We will create code that checks who won each round
-We will create code that takes input (choices) from the user
-We will create code that takes 'input' (choices) from the computer
-We will create code that checks if the user wants to quit, or if the user doesn't enter one of the options(rock, paper, or scissors)
-We will loop each round of the game
-We will add statements at the end and the beginning that welcome and thank the user playing
-We will loop the whole game, so that the user can keep laying until they choose to quit








PSEUDOCODE:
#set variable keepPlaying to true
#While keepPlaying is true:

    #print statement welcoming players to the game
    #print statement stating the rules (best 2 out of 3, press 'q' to quit)
    
    #make a key that assigns a number to  each choice for the computer
    #(rock is 1, scissors is 2, paper is 3)
    
    #import the random function
    
    #set computer's score to 0
    #set player's score to 0
    
    #while player's score is less than 2 and computer's score is less than 2:
    
    
        #computer's choice = random number between 1 and 3
        #player's choice = input player to select Rock, Paper or Scissors
        
        #if player inputs 'q' or 'Q'
        #   set keepPlaying to False
        #   stop the loop
        
        #else if (player inputs and computer chooses rock) or
        #(player inputs paper and computer chooses paper) or
        #(player inputs scissors and computer chooses scissors):
        #   print out DRAW
        #   print out player's score and computer's score
        
        #else if (player inputs rock and computer inputs scissors) or
        #(player inputs scissors and computer inputs paper) or
        #(player inputs paper and computer chooses rock):
        #   add one to the player's score
        #   print out player's score and computer's  score
        
        #else if (player inputs rock and computer paper) or
        #(player inputs scissors and computer chooses rock) or
        #(player inputs paper and computer scissors):
        #   add one to the computer's score
        #   print out player's score and computer's score
        
        #else:
        #   tell the user input was not valid
        
#print statement thanking the players for playing
#if player's score is 2:
#   print statement letting player know they won
#if computer's score is 2
#   print statement letting player know the computer won
#print out player's score and computer's score
